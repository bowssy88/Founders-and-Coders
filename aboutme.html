      <h1> About Me </h1>
<p>I'm loud, and I sometimes talk alot. I'm also an ambituious workaholic who is addicted to learning about everything.<br><br>
  I was born in Saudi Arabia, to Egyptian parents. I then moved to London when I was one years old, and have lived here ever since. <br><br> I studied International Politics at Kings College London University. As soon as I began my degree, the Egyptian revolution occured and we witnessed the Arab Spring.It was at this moment when I first noticed the true capability of technology. Empowerment to the less able, an anti-oppression force that can change the world for the better.  I started realising that my path in life was not going to be the usual one. I needed to build something and make a mark on the world. <br><br> At the age of 19, during my second year of university, I decided to do just that. I had been working since the age of 12, and had saved up enough money to take a leap of faith. I decided to open up my own business and build a happy brand. Everyone told me I was crazy. To be fair, I guess they were partly right? <br><br>I noticed an opportunity in Brentwood, Essex, and took the chance. <a href="https://www.yayashakes.co.uk">YAYA</a> was born. Five years on, and YAYA has over 3000 social media followers, been on the terrible TV show "The Only Way Is Essex", and have been finalists in the British Smoothie Championships.<br><br> <b>Enter coding.</b> After a few years in YAYA, my family had some big problems. These events made me revaluate everything. I thought about my original goal of making a positive impact and mark on the world. Owning a shop is great, and who knows, in 10 years I could have 10 of them. However what positive impact am I really making to the world? I convened with friends, one of whom was Nafisa Bakkar , who had just graduated from Founders & Coders. I finally realised that the path to empowerment of people all around the world is technology. I began learning to code on codeacademy and was suprised to find that I really enjoyed it! Something challenging, yet dynamic. I haven't stopped ever since.<br><br> </p>
