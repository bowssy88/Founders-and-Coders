      <p> Hi Founders & Coders team!</p>
<p>So this is my first ever website. Let me try and explain what I am feeling right now. It's ecstaticness, and excitement, all in one. The blood, sweat, and tears in the form of hours that I have spent self-teaching myself have culminated to this very moment! I'm actually typing words in raw HTML code, and these words are actually appearing in the markdown preview?! The word <b> DOPE</b> comes to mind. <br><br><br> However at the same time I am quite scared and worried as I know that when compared to the websites of other applicants to Founders and Coders, my website it probably the worst. Nevertheless, here I am, doing my best. If anything, this website is the reason why I am so determined to join the course. I want to improve my skills. When I say "improve", what I actually mean is that one day I want to be the BEST. I may be crazy and ambitious , but like my mother used to say,<i> "If you want to reach the moon, aim for the stars."</i> Whether I get into the summer 2017 cohort or not, this application process has been one hell of a learning curve and I am thankful for it. </p>

  <u><h4> Poem: We Are All Hamsters </h4></u>

<pre>We are all hamsters
Locked up in a cage,
Let me tell you why
It might fill your heart with rage
</pre>

<pre>
Age 21, we wake up early, and put on our best hamster suit
Some like a coffee
Before we all begin our route
Through the tunnels
Tunnels, so busy, so thin
As other hamsters panic and rush to get in
</pre>

<pre>
On time. We arrive,
And jump straight onto the hamster wheel
Of our desks where we run, and run,
Until out eyes get sore
The owners out there having fun
But demanding more and more
Run faster, run quicker
I promise, I’ll give you a treat
At the end of the month in your feeding dish you’ll have more to eat
</pre>

<pre>At dinner. Drained, you're back at home
The burrow feels warm,
But you wish you were free to roam
In the wild, cage-less, as you please
Thoughts that stay with you until your body starts to seize
up. Retirement, now you’re sixty-five,
oh what a time, to be alive
the hamster suit comes off permanently.
</pre>

<pre>
So if your stuck in a job, or situation that you hate,
A toxic relationship or stress,
Too much on your plate
Just remember that enjoying your time is the key
For life is short and all humans must be free
Have courage, smile, take risks and prosper,
Fail just as much as Tottenham Hotspur
</pre>

<pre>
Take action, have confidence, it will all be OK,
Because we are not furry hamsters at the end of the day.
</pre>
