      <p1> Hi Founders and Coders team!</p1>
<p2>So this is my first ever website. Let me try and explain what I am feeling right now.
  It's ecstaticness, and excitement, all in one. The blood, sweat, and tears in the form of hours that I have spent 
  self-teaching myself have culminated to this very moment! I'm actually typing words in raw HTML code, and these words are 
  actually appearing in the markdown preview?! The word <b> DOPE</b> comes to mind. <br><br><br> However at the same time 
  I am quite scared and worried as I know that when compared to the websites of other applicants to Founders and Coders, my website 
  it probably the worst. Nevertheless, here I am, doing my best. If anything, this website is the reason why I am so determined 
  to join the course. I want to improve my skills. When I say "improve", what I actually mean is that one day I want to be the BEST. 
  I may be crazy and ambitious , but like my mother used to say,<i> "If you want to reach the moon, aim for the stars."</i> Whether
  I get into the summer 2017 cohort or not, this application process has been one hell of a learning curve and I am thankful for it.</p2>
